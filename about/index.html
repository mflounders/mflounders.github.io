<h1> Welcome </h1>
<p>I'm a medical student interested in the intersection of medicine, neuroscience, and mental health. I live in Philadelphia, PA and love to run. In my future, I aspire to be a doctor who writes <i>and</i> responds to code - always learning along the way<br>

<h2> Research </h2>
My research is focused on understanding the brain with non-invasive multi-modal imaging. 
During my post-baccalaureate fellowship with <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/helab/">Biyu He</a>, I studied visual perception using fMRI and MEG methods and multivariate pattern analysis.  
Recently, I am applying neuroimaging analysis in clinical settings to develop individualized treatments for depression under the mentorship of <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/oatheslab/">Desmond Oathes</a>.<br>

<h2> Highlighted Project </h2>
Resting fMRI-guided TMS results in subcortical and brain network modulation indexed by interleaved TMS/fMRI
<blockquote>Traditional non-invasive imaging methods describe statistical associations of functional co-activation over time. They cannot easily establish hierarchies in communication as done in non-human animals using invasive methods. Here, we interleaved functional MRI (fMRI) recordings with non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to map causal communication between the frontal cortex and subcortical target structures including the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) and the amygdala. Seed-based correlation maps from each participantâ€™s resting fMRI scan determined individual stimulation sites with high temporal correlation to targets for the subsequent TMS/fMRI session(s).</blockquote>
