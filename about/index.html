<h1> Welcome </h1>
<p>I'm a neurology resident interested in the intersection of movement disorders, cognition, and cerebrovascular disease. I live in Pennsylvania and love to run. In my career, I aspire to be a perceptive, empathetic, and intellectually curious physician<br>

<h2> Research </h2>
My research has been primarily focused on understanding the brain with non-invasive multi-modal imaging. 
During my post-baccalaureate fellowship at the NINDS with <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/helab/">Biyu He</a>, I studied the spatiotemporal dynamics of how prior knowledge influences visual perception using fMRI, MEG, and multivariate pattern analysis.  
Most recently, I applied neuroimaging analysis in clinical settings to create individualized, targeted brain stimulation protocols for treatment-resistent depression under the mentorship of <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/oatheslab/">Desmond Oathes</a>.
As a resident at <a href="https://www.neurology.pitt.edu/training/residency-program">UPMC</a>, I hope to investigate the intersection of neuroinflammation and cognition with neuroimaging in clinical populations with neurodegenerative conditions and diagnoses of mild cognitive impairment<br>

<h2> Highlighted Project </h2>
ASLPrep: a platform for processing of arterial spin labeled MRI and quantification of regional brain perfusion
<br>
<i>led by <a href="https://github.com/a3sha2">Azeez Adebimpe</a> and <a href="https://www.pennlinc.io">PennLINC team</a></i>
<blockquote>Arterial spin labeled (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the primary method for non-invasively measuring regional brain perfusion in humans. We introduce ASLPrep, a suite of software pipelines that ensure the reproducible and generalizable processing of ASL MRI data</blockquote>
