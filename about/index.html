<h1> Welcome </h1>
<p>I'm a medical student interested in the intersection of medicine, neuroscience, and mental health. I live in Philadelphia, PA and love to run. In my future, I aspire to be a doctor who writes <i>and</i> responds to code - always learning along the way<br>

<h2> Research </h2>
My research is focused on understanding the brain with non-invasive multi-modal imaging. 
During my post-baccalaureate fellowship with <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/helab/">Biyu He</a>, I studied visual perception using fMRI and MEG methods and multivariate pattern analysis.  
Recently, I am applying neuroimaging analysis in clinical settings to develop individualized treatments for depression under the mentorship of <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/oatheslab/">Desmond Oathes</a>.<br>

<h2> Highlighted Project </h2>
Individualized non-invasive brain stimulation engages the subgenual anterior cingulate and amygdala
<blockquote>Brain stimulation is used clinically to treat a variety of neurological and psychiatric conditions. The mechanisms of the clinical effects of these brain-based therapies are presumably dependent on their effects on brain networks. It has been hypothesized that using individualized brain network maps is an optimal strategy for defining network boundaries and topologies. Traditional non-invasive imaging can determine correlations between structural or functional time series. However, they cannot easily establish hierarchies in communication flow as done in non-human animals using invasive methods</blockquote>
