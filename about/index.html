<h1> Welcome </h1>
<p>I'm a medical student interested in the intersection of mental health, neuroscience, and medicine. I live in Philadelphia, PA and love to run. I aspire to be a doctor who writes <i>and</i> responds to code - always learning along the way<br>

<h2> Education </h2>
BSc in Neuroscience | <i>University of Pittsburgh '15</i><br>
DO Candidate | <i>Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine '23</i><br>
<br>
<h2> Research </h2>
My research is focused on understanding the brain with non-invasive multi-modal imaging. 
During my post-baccalaureate fellowship at the NIH with <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/helab/">Biyu He</a>, I studied visual perception using fMRI and MEG methods and multivariate pattern analysis.  
Recently, I have applied neuroimaging analysis in clinical settings to develop individualized treatment for depression under the mentorship of <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/oatheslab/">Desmond Oathes</a> at UPenn.<br>

<h2> Highlighted Project </h2>
Neural dynamics of visual ambiguity by perceptual prior, <i>eLife</i> 2019 <br>
<blockquote>Perception reflects not only immediate patterns of sensory inputs but also memories acquired through prior experiences with the world (Helmholtz, 1924; Albright, 2012). For instance, reading handwriting greatly depends on our existing knowledge of vocabulary and grammar. Stored representations from previous experiences provide likely interpretations of sensory data about their cause and meaning, overcoming the ever-present noise, ambiguity and incompleteness of retinal image. However, to date neural mechanisms underlying prior experiencesâ€™ influence on visual perception remain largely unknown.</blockquote>
