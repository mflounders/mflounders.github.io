<h1> About Me: </h1>
<p>I'm a medical student interested in the intersection of mental health, neuroscience, and medicine. I live in Philadelphia, PA and love to run. I aspire to be a doctor who codes - always learning along the way.<br>

<h2> Education: </h2>
BSc in Neuroscience | <i>University of Pittsburgh</i> '15<br>
DO Candidate | <i>Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine, Class of 2023</i><br>

<h2> Research: </h2>
My research is focused on understanding the brain with non-invasive multi-modal imaging <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2E66toIAAAAJ&hl=en">[Google Scholar]</a>.<br> 
During my post-baccalaureate fellowship at the NIH with <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/helab/"><b>Biyu He</b></a>, I studied visual perception using fMRI and MEG methods and multivariate pattern analysis.  
Recently, I have applied neuroimaging analysis in clinical settings to develop individualized treatment for depression under the mentorship of <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/oatheslab/"><b>Desmond Oathes</b></a> at UPenn.<br>

<h2> Highlighted Project: </h2>
Neural Dynamics of visual ambiguity by perceptual prior<br>
